# Acari Sans
A continuation of the development of HK Grotesk Cyrillic font

Acari Sans (named after a fish native from Central and South America, also referred to as 'cascudo')
is forked from HK Grotesk Version 1.045, last version that supports Cyrillic. The first modifications are
duplexed tabular numerals, and fixed some glyphs.
